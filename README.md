Battlefield 4 is a great game to start learning with

    Modern engine
    Basic anti cheat to reverse and bypass
    Awesome things to do with so many different projectiles and objects


This code was written about a year ago when I was bored and decided to play some BF4.
It is super minimalistic. The entire thing is a single file, about 500 lines, very easy to understand and learn from.
It doesn't have an aimbot because I always thought aimbot gets boring quickly and usually ruin the game for me.
All strings are obfuscated on compile time, so it will be a bit more difficult to sign this code.
Screenshot cleaner (both Punkbuster and Fair Fight) was tested using a modified server using the leaked server files that floated around.

Overall I feel it can be great base for something bigger.
